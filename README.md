webscarep-setup
===============

Sets up a node + domjs + jquery webscraping environment for you, ie. installs necessary node modules, downloads newest jquery and hands you an example script.

## Usage

Easiest (and totally safe) way to use this script: 

    curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mjleino/webscrape-setup/master/scrape-setup.sh | sh

## Props

Thanks to Charlies Robbins, [the script is based on his blog post](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/jsdom-jquery-in-5-lines-on-nodejs).
